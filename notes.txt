    1. write a java program to swap given two numbers using third variable
    2. write a java program to swap given two numbers without using third variable  (a=a+b;b=a-b;a=a-b)
    3. write a java program to print the 
        a. area of the triangle     (0.5*base*height)
        b. area of the rhombus      (0.5*diagonal1*diagonal2)
        c. area of the trapezium    (height*0.5*(a+b))


Day 2:  (09-09-2025)
    Operators:
        Operator is a symbol that can perform the symbol related operations among the operands or variables.
        Ex:
            + addition
            - subtraction
            * multiplication
            / division
            % modulus
        
        Different types of operators:
            1. Arithmetic operators (+,-,*,/,%)
            2. Relational operators (>,<,==,!=,<=,>=)
            3. Logical operators (&&,||, !)
            4. Assignment operators (=,+=,-=,*=,/=,%=)
            5. Ternary operators (condition ? true statement : false statement)
            6. Increment and Decrement operators (++ , --)


    Conditional statements:
        The statements are executed based on the condition.
    
        1. Decision / Selection method:
            i. single way selection
                if, if-else, if-else-if, nested if
                    Program: write a java program to print largest of two numbers using if else.
                
            ii. multi way selection
        
        2. Loops
            i. while
            ii. do-while
            iii. for
            iv. for each

        3. Jumping Statements
